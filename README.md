Some projects I've done during my time at UCL (still ongoing, updates to come):

- COMP0169 Machine Learning for Visual Computing: coding a neural network from scratch, using linear and non-linear classifiers, building with Pytorch autoencoders and VAE using in particular convolutional layers

- COMP0026 Image Processing: implementing segmentation algorithm (K-means, tresholding), and coding a method for warping two images (with a triangulation, and meshless)

- COMP0137 Machine Vision: implementing an expectation-maximization model to separate a mixture of Gaussian for visual data
