Some projects I've done during my time at UCL (still ongoing, updates to come):

- COMP0169 Machine Learning for Visual Computing: coding a neural network from scratch, using linear and non-linear classifiers, building with Pytorch autoencoders and VAE using in particular convolutional layers

- COMP0026 Image Processing: implementing segmentation algorithms (K-means, tresholding), a coding a method for warping two images (rigid transform with a triangulation, and meshless), and implementing Poisson image editing (from "Poisson Image Editing", Pérez et al., SIGGRAPH 2003) for image interpolation (seamless cloning, mixing gradients, and texture flattening).

- COMP0137 Machine Vision: implementing an expectation-maximization model to separate a mixture of Gaussian for visual data, and a coursework on tracking (with a particle filter) and homographies with the aim of producing a 3D cube in augmented reality.

- COMP0114 Inverse Problems in Imaging: investigating optimization solutions depending on the norm chosen, the SVD decomposition of well and ill-conditioned matrices, comparing algorithms using a matrix VS using a handle function, implementing a Kyrlov solver for denoising blurry images using the Laplacian of the image, and conducting a paper review of "Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements" from Candès et al., 2005.

- COMP0118 Computational Modelling for Biomedical Imaging: the first coursework covered parameter mapping, uncertainty estimation, and model selection on part of the Human Connectome Project data. The second coursework dealt with statistics, especially on F-tests, p-values, estimation and error spaces.

- COMP0119 Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry: the first coursework covered ICP, point-to-point VS point-to-plane, the importance of the mesh's initial position, its robustness to noise, and global alignment. The second coursework dealt with mesh denoising and smoothing, using methods involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Laplacian for 3D meshes), uniform and non-uniform Laplacian discretizations, modal analysis, implicit and explicit smoothing, and finally a differential geometry part dealing with the first and second fundamental forms of a 3D figure.
